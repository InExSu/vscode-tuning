For those who are not satisfied with the use of standard Vim keys HJKL.
Use JIKL.

No need to switch modes and standard keys work as it was.

You don't need to memorize a lot of strange keyboard shortcuts at once.

It's not about the amount of writing, but about the convenience! If programming is not about "typing", but about "thinking", it only means that a set of code should not distract from thoughts. Dragging your hand back and forth and constantly looking for bumps is terribly distracting and infuriating.

Performance is not improved by typing, but by:
- the stream is not interrupted,
- the context does not switch during typing.
This can only be felt when typing blindly - Thoughts materialize without additional effort.
Until you try, do not evaluate, but as you evaluate, then all other methods will enrage you with their slowness.
